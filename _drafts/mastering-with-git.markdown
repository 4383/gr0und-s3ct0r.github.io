## Introduction
Work on project with people must be controlled by rules, systems, and best
pratices work ensure the long life of the project.

Working on a project may address serveral cases. It could be a single developper who needs to version his code, a working team which needs to work together easily, or an open project which let the capability to contribute to other developpers than the core team.

This post introduce a complete describe of these use cases and offer to you step by step explaination of these and the 
best pratices for manage them properly.

First, we introduce a global overview of what was a project? 
This part can interess people who want to setup a complete workflow on project management.

Seconde, we explain to users how to contribute to projects. Considere users on this part
who was external to the core team of a product and doesn't have the right to write directly
on the upstream project.

Third, we will help core team to manage workflow and work with contributors.

if you are familiar with these concept you doesn't have read this post entirely and you can switch 
directly in the part of your choice.

Folks who manage projects like DevOps, project manager, project owner, etc can be interested by the 
totality of this post.

We have split this post by categories for helping people to stay focused on themes.

We have encountered all of these cases and issues during our respective experiences at work and during contributions
to opensource projects.

we have gathered a whole lot of good practices that we return to you today through this post.

we hope you find your happiness!
